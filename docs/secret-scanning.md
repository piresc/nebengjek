# Automated Secret Protection

Nebengjek employs advanced secret scanning technology to automatically protect sensitive information and prevent security breaches by detecting and blocking the accidental exposure of credentials, API keys, and other secrets.

## Security Protection Features

### üõ°Ô∏è **Proactive Security Defense**
Automated secret detection acts as a security shield, preventing sensitive information from ever entering your codebase and protecting against data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance violations.

## Comprehensive Security Coverage

### üîç **Intelligent Threat Detection**
Advanced pattern recognition technology automatically identifies potential security threats across your entire codebase:

- **Real-time Protection**: Every code change is immediately scanned for sensitive information
- **Historical Analysis**: Complete git history scanning ensures no legacy secrets remain hidden
- **Zero-tolerance Policy**: Automatically blocks dangerous code from entering production
- **Instant Alerts**: Immediate notification when potential security risks are detected

### üß† **Smart Detection Engine**
Intelligent configuration ensures accurate threat detection while minimizing false alarms:

- **Industry Standards**: Leverages proven patterns for detecting common credential types
- **Technology-Specific Rules**: Specialized detection for Go applications and database connections
- **Context-Aware Filtering**: Intelligently distinguishes between real threats and test data
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously refined patterns reduce noise and improve accuracy

### üéØ **Comprehensive Threat Coverage**
Protects against a wide range of security vulnerabilities by detecting multiple types of sensitive information:

- **üîë API Credentials**: Service tokens, authentication keys, and third-party API access credentials
- **üóÑÔ∏è Database Secrets**: Connection strings for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, and other databases
- **üîê Cryptographic Keys**: RSA, EC, DSA, and OpenSSH private keys that could compromise encryption
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Credentials**: AWS, GCP, Azure, and other cloud provider access keys
- **üîí High-Entropy Secrets**: Automatically detects randomly generated passwords and tokens
- **üéØ Application-Specific**: Custom patterns tailored to our microservices architecture

## Usage

### Local Development

Developers can run secret scanning locally before committing:

```bash
# Install GitLeaks
brew install gitleaks

# Scan current repository
gitleaks detect --config .gitleaks.toml --verbose

# Scan specific files
gitleaks detect --config .gitleaks.toml --source . --verbose
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

Secret scanning runs automatically in the CI pipeline:

1. **Trigger**: On pull requests and pushes to master
2. **Execution**: GitLeaks scans the entire repository history
3. **Results**: 
   - ‚úÖ **Pass**: No secrets detected, pipeline continues
   - ‚ùå **Fail**: Secrets detected, pipeline stops, PR blocked

### Handling False Positives

If the scanner detects a false positive:

1. **Review**: Verify it's actually a false positive, not a real secret
2. **Update Configuration**: Add the pattern to `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist
3. **Document**: Add a comment explaining why it's safe

```toml
# Example: Adding a false positive to allowlist
[allowlist]
regexes = [
    '''your-false-positive-pattern''',
]
```

### Handling Real Secrets

If real secrets are detected:

1. **Immediate Action**: Remove the secret from the code
2. **Rotate Credentials**: Change the exposed secret immediately
3. **History Cleanup**: Consider using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner for sensitive cases
4. **Prevention**: Use environment variables or secret management systems

## Best Practices

### For Developers

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- **Local Scanning**: Run GitLeaks locally before committing
- **Secret Management**: Use proper secret management tools (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
- **Code Reviews**: Review code changes for potential secrets during PR reviews

### For Configuration

- **Minimal Secrets**: Keep the number of secrets in the application minimal
- **Rotation**: Implement regular secret rotation policies
- **Access Control**: Limit access to secrets based on the principle of least privilege
- **Monitoring**: Monitor secret usage and access patterns

## Configuration Files

### .gitleaks.toml

Main configuration file that defines:
- Scanning rules and patterns
- Allowlist for false positives
- Custom rules for application-specific patterns

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Integrated into `.github/workflows/continuous-integration.yml`:
- Runs GitLeaks action
- Blocks pipeline on secret detection
- Provides detailed feedback

## Monitoring and Alerts

- **GitHub Actions**: Failed workflows notify team members
- **Pull Request Checks**: PR status checks prevent merging when secrets are detected
- **Security Tab**: GitHub Security tab shows secret scanning alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **False Positives**: Update `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist
2. **Performance**: Large repositories may take longer to scan
3. **History Scanning**: Full history scans can detect old secrets

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Verbose output for debugging
gitleaks detect --config .gitleaks.toml --verbose --log-level debug

# Test specific rules
gitleaks detect --config .gitleaks.toml --verbose --log-opts '--since="2024-01-01"'
```

## Security Considerations

- **Regular Updates**: Keep GitLeaks and rules updated
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Scan all branches and history
- **Team Training**: Educate team on secret management best practices
- **Incident Response**: Have a plan for when secrets are detected

## Integration with Other Tools

Secret scanning complements other security tools:
- **SonarCloud**: Code quality and security analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: Vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **SAST Tools**: Static application security testing

This multi-layered approach provides comprehensive security coverage for the application.
